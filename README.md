# Reading_List

This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of books that I have read from cover to cover since January 2021. It presents an engaging word cloud and an interactive dashboard, offering a captivating visualization of my literary journey.

This personal project serves as a means to meticulously trace the words that have shaped my mind throughout the year. It's intriguing to note that, on average, Americans read [12](https://bookriot.com/how-many-books-does-the-average-person-read/) books annually, with [65%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/222754/book-format-used-by-readers-in-the-us/) of them being print books. This statistic surpassed my initial expectations and inspired me to delve into a wider range of non-academic literature.

Furthermore, in recognizing the profound influence of everyday language in our lives, I am devoted to purposefully incorporating specific words and ideas into my consciousness on a daily basis. This endeavor serves as a deliberate effort to enhance my awareness and expand my intellectual horizons.

By combining my passion for data science with my love for learning, this project displays both my technical expertise and my commitment to personal growth.
