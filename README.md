# Reading_List
This is a compilation of all the books I have read since 2021, presented in the form of a wordmap

This is an attempt to track the words conditioning my mind throughout the year. We are unintentionally conditioned daily through
casual encounters, I want to be more intentional about getting certain words and Ideas in my mind on a daily basis.
