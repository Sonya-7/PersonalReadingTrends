# Reading_List
This is a compilation of all the books I have read since January 2021, presented in the form of a wordmap.

This is my attempt to track the words conditioning my mind throughout the year. Since we are conditioned daily through language in casual encounters, my aim is to be more intentional about getting certain words and ideas in my mind on a daily basis.
